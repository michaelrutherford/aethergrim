# Aethergrim

## About
Aethergrim is a coffee-break roguelike game that you can play in your terminal.

The goal is simple: descend down the 3 levels of the dungeon and find the ring.
Beware: ghosts haunt the halls and will pursue you if they see you.
Be sure to use any health potions you find along the way; you will need them!

## Dependencies
- libncurses-dev

## Building
In the project's home directory, run the command:
> make

## Running
In the directory you ran the above command in, run the command:

## Roadmap
As it stands, the game is complete, but lacking in mechanics, polish, and variety.
Below is a list of features that I hope to implement on the road to the 1.0 release.

- [ ] Character creation screen
- [ ] Player attributes
- [ ] Equippable items
- [ ] Enemy variety
- [ ] Item variety
- [ ] Expand on the lore
